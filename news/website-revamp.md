# Website Revamp Complete

We're excited to announce that the ASCSN website has undergone a complete revamp! This update represents our commitment to providing a better user experience and more streamlined access to our resources.

## Technology Stack

Our revamped website is built using modern web technologies:

- **Next.js**: A React framework that enables server-side rendering and static site generation, providing faster page loads and better SEO.
- **Markdown**: All our content is managed in Markdown format, making it easier to maintain and update.
- **CSS Modules**: For component-scoped styling that prevents style conflicts.
- **Static Site Generation**: Pages are pre-rendered at build time for optimal performance.

## Key Improvements

The website reorganization includes:

- Consolidated content under a unified "News" section
- Improved navigation and content organization
- Enhanced mobile responsiveness
- Better integration with our other platforms (Forum, GitHub, YouTube)
- Optimized performance and loading times

## What's Next

We're continuously working to improve our digital presence. In the coming months, we plan to:

- Add more educational resources
- Create more interactive components

We welcome your feedback on the new design! Please visit our [forum](https://forum.ascsn.net) to share your thoughts or suggestions for further improvements.
