I think it's appropriate to do a big

*__Hello World!__*

here on account of the launch of a few neat ASCSN tools and resources recently! The most important launch is, of course, the very website you're reading right now. I doubt that the news section itself will be populated with hyper-frequent posts though this page will serve as a nice highlight of ASCSN initiatives and act as a centralized location to access materials produced by ASCSN members.

As additional tools and resources are launched, they will likely have an associated news update with some context explaining what the intended use case is and describe how to use it and get involved. Core features like the education and workforce development materials will be linked in a forthcoming page in a header or sidebar to ensure ease of access. The same applies to the [ASCSN Forum](https://forum.ascsn.net) and [chat](https://chat.ascsn.net) functionality.
