This repository houses the main landing page for ASCSN and is primarily a compendium of links heading to other webapps and pages. The base code of the page is from a Vercel tutorial for a next.js deployment that was repurposed by ASCSN for a professional website primer summer school session and is designed to be easy for other organizations to copy and use for their own landing pages.
